# Disease subtype discovery using multi-omics data integration
This project has the aim of clustering  samples regarding Pancreatic adenocarcinoma coming from a dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas. In particular we want to partition the samples into disease subtypes, and compare the solutions with the one proposed in [@abeshouse2015molecularPRAD].
The main document is a report that goes into detail about:
* data pre-processing
* used data integration methods for the multi-omics data
* chosen clustering methods
* comparison of the results with respect to iCluster method

This repository also contains the R code used for all the computation needed in the sections outlined in the report.

## Contents
* `project.Rmd` is the R notebook that contains the code and step-by-step description of the blocks
* `project.nb.html` is the rendering of the notebook
* `report.pdf` is the project report
* `report.tex` contains the $\LaTeX$ source code
